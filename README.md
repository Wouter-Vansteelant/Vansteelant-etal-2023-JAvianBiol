# A trans-African migrant shows repeatable route choice in males and repeatable timing in females
---
Migratory movement data of Canarian Eleonora's falcons, tracked with UvA-BiTS GPS loggers, and resampled to hourly resolution are provided via Dryad: JAV-03050.R3

This GitHub repository contains the R code to reproduce all analyses in Vansteelant et al (2023) J Avian Biol.

## Description of the data and file structure

 * run scripts one by one in order indicated by first 2-3 symbols of script: p1, p1b, p2, p2b, ...
 * store all codes in a dedicated working directory
 * store tracking data made available through Dryad in a subfolder 'data' of your working directory folder
 * store third-party environmental data in a subfolder 'environmental data' on main hard drive, ordjust this to your preferences. 

The code to replicate analyses is made available through GitHub (see below). Code automatically installs all required packages for reproducing the analyses.
